  <h1>Welcome to Keywords Hatch!!!</h1>
  <p>This is a <b>keyword tool</b> with which you could easily format your keywords the way you want.
   Although this tool is originally intended for Amazon keywords formatting, you could also use it for other
   platforms as longs as the format is right.
  </p>
  <p>
      At this moment only <b>Instashaper</b> and <b>Ad Phrases</b> are available. They both filter the keywords
      you input by deleting most of
      the brands and re-arrange them into groups of 1000, 500 or other number you choose characters
      so that you could easily put them in your
      search terms. You don't have to worry about case issues as this tool automatically transform all input
      words to lower case to match the brands. The result generated by <b>Instashaper</b> are individual
      non-redundant word
      while <b>Ad Phrases</b>'s result are phrases with repeated words.
  </p>
  <p>More features will be added soon!!!</p>
